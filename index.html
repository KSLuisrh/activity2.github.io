        <p class="p-detail">
            <strong>Mérida</strong> the capital and largest city in Yucatán state in Mexico, as well as the largest city
            of the Yucatán Peninsula. The city is located in the northwest part of the state, about 35 kilometres (22
            miles) off the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. The city is also the municipal seat of the Municipality of
            Mérida, which includes the city and the areas around it.

        <p class="p-detail">
            Mérida features a tropical wet and dry climate (Köppen: Aw).[7] The city lies in the trade wind belt close to
            the Tropic of Cancer, with the prevailing wind from the east. Mérida's climate is hot and its humidity is
            moderate to high, depending on the time of year. The average annual high temperature is 33 °C (91 °F),
            ranging from 28 °C (82 °F) in January to 36 °C (97 °F) in May, but temperatures often rise above 38 °C (100
            °F) in the afternoon in this time. Low temperatures range between 18 °C (64 °F) in January to 23 °C (73 °F)
            in May and June. It is most often a few degrees hotter in Mérida than in coastal areas due to its inland
            location and low elevation. The rainy season runs from June through October, associated with the Mexican
            monsoon which draws warm, moist air landward. Easterly waves and tropical storms also affect the area during
            this season.
